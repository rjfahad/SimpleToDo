## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 9, 2025**

Simple ToDo is an open-source task management application maintained by rjfahad. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use Simple ToDo. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

By using Simple ToDo, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### Our Privacy Commitment

**Simple ToDo prioritizes your privacy. All your tasks and data are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal information on any remote servers.**

**Information Collection and Use**

Simple ToDo operates on a privacy-first principle:

- **Local Storage Only**: All your tasks, notes, and settings are stored exclusively on your device
- **No Account Required**: You don't need to create an account or provide personal information
- **No Data Transmission**: Your task data is never sent to external servers
- **No Analytics**: We do not collect usage statistics or analytics
- **No Advertising**: The app is completely ad-free

**Permissions Used:**

- **Storage Permission**: Required for backup and restore functionality. This allows you to save your tasks to a file and restore them later
- **Notification Permission**: Required to send reminders for your tasks
- **Alarm Permission**: Required to schedule task reminders at specific times

These permissions are only used for their stated purposes and do not involve any data collection.

**Log Data**

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

**Third-Party Services**

Simple ToDo does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app operates completely independently without external dependencies.

**Links to Other Sites**

While the app itself doesn't contain external links, our documentation (README, GitHub) may link to external resources. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external websites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

**Children's Privacy**

Simple ToDo is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no privacy concerns related to children's data. The app can be safely used by anyone, including children under 13, as no data collection occurs.

**Open Source**

Simple ToDo is open-source software. You can review the complete source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rjfahad/SimpleToDo) to verify our privacy claims and see exactly how the app works.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
